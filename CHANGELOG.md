# Changelog

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2026-07-19 — Lumo

First public beta of **Lumo**, a fork of [Soia](https://github.com/FengZeng/soia)
rebuilt around a rich, per-video picture-quality and personalization workflow.
Everything below is new in Lumo on top of the upstream player.

### Picture quality & grading

- **Auto Enhance** — one-press smart auto-correction. Samples the current frame
  and automatically fixes levels (contrast), exposure (brightness), colour cast
  (white balance), and dull colour (saturation), then fills the sliders so you
  can fine-tune. Algorithmic — fast and reliable, no cloud, no wait.
- **Colour grade** — GPU sliders for Exposure, Temperature, Tint, Highlights and
  Shadows (alongside Brightness/Contrast/Saturation/Gamma/Hue).
- **Sharpness** — GPU unsharp mask with independent Amount and Radius (crisp
  edges through to a broad local-contrast / "HDR" glow). No decode penalty.
- **Film Grain** — animated, luminance-aware GPU grain for a filmic texture.
- **Denoise** and **Deinterlace** toggles for noisy / interlaced sources.
- **Quality presets** (Fast / Balanced / High) for mpv's scaler and debanding.
- **AI Upscaling** — one-click bundled Anime4K (anime) and ravu (live-action).

### Looks & presets

- **Presets** — 8 built-in looks (Punch, Warm, Cool, Vivid, Calm, B&W, B&W Warm,
  Vintage) plus save-your-own named custom presets (a reusable library).
- **Per-video memory** — the full look (brightness/contrast/saturation/gamma/hue
  + colour grade + sharpen/denoise/deinterlace/grain) is remembered per file and
  restored on reopen. A Reset button clears the current video's look; a Global
  toggle applies one look to every video instead.

### Seek-bar thumbnails

- **Hover previews** on the seek bar. A background headless mpv instance
  pre-renders frames per local file (no playback interruption), cached to disk.
- **Adaptive & configurable** — one frame every N seconds (Settings → Advanced),
  with an on/off toggle and automatic cache cleanup.

### Favourites

- Favourite videos while watching (top-bar heart, `B` shortcut), a Favourites
  thumbnail-grid view, and a Favourites list in the playlist drawer so prev/next
  can walk your favourites.

### Window & framing

- **Aspect-ratio cycle** (`E`): Default / 16:9 / 4:3 / 21:9 / 2.35:1, remembered
  per file; the window auto-fits to remove letterboxing.
- **Fit window to video** (`G`), remembered per file.
- **Step window resize** (`Alt` +/−) keeping aspect.
- **Window size lock** — keep one window size across all videos (toggleable).

### Crop & playlist

- **Auto-Crop Black Bars** with an adjustable black threshold for noisy / analog
  sources; the detected crop is remembered per file.
- **Auto-Load Folder to Playlist** — playing a local file loads its whole folder.

### Shortcuts & polish

- **Configurable keyboard shortcuts** — every action rebindable, with a live
  help overlay.
- **Screenshots** with a configurable folder (JPG fallback for builds without a
  PNG encoder).
- Faster cold start; telemetry / auto-updater phone-home removed.
- The installer no longer ticks "Create desktop shortcut" by default.
